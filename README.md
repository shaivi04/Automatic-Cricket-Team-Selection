# Automatic-Cricket-Team-Selection
Took on one of the most exciting challenges in the American Express Campus Challenge 2024 ‚Äî and made it to the Top 3 out of 1300+ teams!

Over 3 intense rounds, I built an advanced cricket team selection model by working on 80,000+ rows across multiple datasets.
Used Python and Pandas to create a smart player selection system that balanced recent performance and consistency ‚Äî and helped form the best possible team on paper.

One of the most fun and rewarding problems I‚Äôve worked on!

## üìä Data Processing Steps  

### **Data Cleaning**  
- **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate records from the dataset.  
- **Handling Null Values**:  
  - Calculated missing **strike rates** as `total runs / balls faced`.  
  - Estimated missing **runs** using the formula: `economy rate * balls bowled / 6`.  
  - Filled missing **city values** in match-level data using the **venue** column.  
  - Replaced missing values in **categorical columns** with `'unknown'`.  

### **Outlier Detection**  
- Identified **min/max values** for each column.  
- Used the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method** to detect and handle outliers.  

### **3Ô∏èData Type Conversion**  
- Converted **string values** in numerical columns to **integers** for consistency.

## üìà Statistical Analysis  
Statistical measures were applied to evaluate player performance across multiple dimensions:  

- **Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)**:  
  - Assigned **higher weights** to more **recent matches**.  
  - Weights decrease **exponentially** over time.  
- **Rolling Window Method**:  
  - Processed match data **sequentially** from most recent to oldest within each **batsman group**.  
- **Consistency Measurement**:  
  - Used **rolling standard deviation** to assess **player consistency**.

## üéØ Query Execution & Team Selection  
- **Data Filtering & Manipulation**: Used **Pandas** queries to extract relevant insights.  
- **Player Selection**: Identified **top-performing** batsmen and bowlers based on **recent form, consistency, and statistical metrics**.  
- **Balanced Team Formation**: Selected an **optimal mix** of players for a well-rounded team.
