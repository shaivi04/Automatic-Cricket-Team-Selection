# Automatic-Cricket-Team-Selection
This challenge was an incredible journey across 3 intensive rounds, where I worked on developing an advanced cricket team selection model. The task involved analysing 80,000+ entries across multiple datasets - it surely was one of the most interesting problem statements I have had a chance to work on. I developed an optimized player selection model using Python & Pandas, integrating recent form and consistency metrics to construct a well-balanced team. 

Achieved 3rd place (out of 1300+ submissions) in The American Express Campus Challenge 2024 for this project!

## üìä Data Processing Steps  

### **Data Cleaning**  
- **Duplicate Removal**: Eliminated duplicate records from the dataset.  
- **Handling Null Values**:  
  - Calculated missing **strike rates** as `total runs / balls faced`.  
  - Estimated missing **runs** using the formula: `economy rate * balls bowled / 6`.  
  - Filled missing **city values** in match-level data using the **venue** column.  
  - Replaced missing values in **categorical columns** with `'unknown'`.  

### **Outlier Detection**  
- Identified **min/max values** for each column.  
- Used the **Interquartile Range (IQR) method** to detect and handle outliers.  

### **3Ô∏èData Type Conversion**  
- Converted **string values** in numerical columns to **integers** for consistency.

## üìà Statistical Analysis  
Statistical measures were applied to evaluate player performance across multiple dimensions:  

- **Exponential Weighted Moving Average (EWMA)**:  
  - Assigned **higher weights** to more **recent matches**.  
  - Weights decrease **exponentially** over time.  
- **Rolling Window Method**:  
  - Processed match data **sequentially** from most recent to oldest within each **batsman group**.  
- **Consistency Measurement**:  
  - Used **rolling standard deviation** to assess **player consistency**.

## üéØ Query Execution & Team Selection  
- **Data Filtering & Manipulation**: Used **Pandas** queries to extract relevant insights.  
- **Player Selection**: Identified **top-performing** batsmen and bowlers based on **recent form, consistency, and statistical metrics**.  
- **Balanced Team Formation**: Selected an **optimal mix** of players for a well-rounded team.
